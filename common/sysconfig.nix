    # We basically use nscd as a proxy for forwarding nss requests to appropriate
    # nss modules, as we run nscd with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to the directory

    # to just reject the nss requests it receives, which then causes glibc to
    # fallback to trying to handle the request by itself. Which won't work as glibc
    # is not aware of the path in which the nss modules live.  As a workaround, we
